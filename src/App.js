            answerExplanation: `Option C is the correct answer. At line 6 we have created a for loop since we havenâ€™t
                                use the brackets there,
                                the printing statement is not in the scope of the for loop block. So the for loop
                                variable scope ends by line
                                7. At line 8 printing statement prints the value of the static variable x, which is 4.
                                There we have used post
                                decrement operator which has no effect on that line hence option C is correct.`
